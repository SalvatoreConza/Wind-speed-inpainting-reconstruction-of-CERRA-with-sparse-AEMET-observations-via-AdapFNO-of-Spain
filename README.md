## 📖 Overview

Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) are powerful for modeling spatio-temporal dynamics but often emphasize low-frequency patterns, overlooking fine-scale details critical in **climate forecasting**.  
We introduce **AdaptFNO**, an adaptive variant that:

- **Dynamically adjusts spectral modes** based on input frequency content.  
- **Combines global and local operators** for multiscale learning.  
- Uses a **cross-attention mechanism** to align global and local features.  

AdaptFNO effectively captures both **large-scale circulation** and **fine-grained events** such as typhoon trajectories, with efficient long-range stability.

This codebase accompanies our NeurIPS 2025 Workshop paper:  
> *\"AdaptFNO: Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator with Dynamic Spectral Modes and Multiscale Learning for Climate Modeling\"*.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic spectral mode allocation** to handle both low- and high-frequency structures.  
- **Multiscale design**:
  - Global operator (low-res, large-scale patterns)  
  - Local operator (high-res, fine details)  
- **Cross-attention mechanism** for efficient knowledge transfer from global to local forecasts.  
- **Validated on ERA5 reanalysis data** with case studies (e.g., Typhoon Yagi).

## 📈 Results

- **Task:** Short-term climate forecasting (3-day horizon).  
- **Metric:** Temporal Weighted MSE.  
- **Case Study:** Typhoon Yagi trajectory prediction.  

AdaptFNO shows improved accuracy in capturing cyclone formation and fine-scale atmospheric dynamics compared to FNO and CNN baselines.
